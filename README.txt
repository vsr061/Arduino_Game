1) Connect the Circuit as shown in image.

2) I am connecting D7 and D6 pins on lcd to Digital Pins 8 and 9 respectively on Arduino, because Digital pins 2 and 3 are used as Interrupt Pins.

3) I have connected circuit using perfboard as shown in photo.
   
4) Download GALACTIC_FORCE.zip
  
5) Inside Extracted Folder you will get Arduino code.

6) Upload code using Arduino IDE.
   
7) Enjoy.
